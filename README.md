# Scripts-for-Math-Statistics-and-Data-Manipulation
Scripts that helped me during my studies at University of Toronto and my intern at Deloitte
Most of the scripts should be self-explanatory

===MAT301 Group and Symmetries.py===
Zn denotes the multiplicative group of integers modulo n
print_Zn(n)           Print all elements of Zn, return the elements as an ordered list
is_cyclic(n)          Check if Zn is cyclic, return True if cyclic, return False if non-cyclic
print_cycles(n)       Print the cycle generated by every element of Zn, return the cycles as a dictionary
print_generator(n)    Find all generators of Zn, return the generators as a list

===MAT315 Introduction to Number Theory.py===
is_prime(n)           Check if n is prime, return True if is prime, return False if is composite
coprime_list(n)       Return all 1 <= k < n such that (k,n)=1
is_carmichael(n)      Determine if n is a carmichael number, return True if it is, return False if it isn't
phi(n)                Return the number of units in Zn
order(u,n)            Return the order of u modulo p

===STA257 STA261 Plot, Confidence Interval, P-values.R===
This script includes 3 sections: Plotting, CI, and P-values
Each section should cover 4 distributions: Normal Distribution, T Distribution, Chi-squared Distribution, and F Distribution
