# Scripts-for-Math-Statistics-and-Data-Manipulation
Scripts that helped me during my studies at University of Toronto and my intern at Deloitte <br>
Most of the scripts should be self-explanatory <br>

- **MAT301 Group and Symmetries.py** <br>
Zn denotes the multiplicative group of integers modulo <br>
Featuring four functions: print_Zn(n), is_cyclic(n), print_cycles(n), print_generator(n) <br>

- **MAT315 Introduction to Number Theory.py** <br>
Featuring five functions: is_prime(n), coprime_list(n), is_carmichael(n), phi(n), order(u,n) <br> 

- **STA257 STA261 Plot, Confidence Interval, P-values.R** <br>
This script includes 3 sections: Plotting, CI, and P-values <br>
Each section should cover 4 distributions: Normal Distribution, T Distribution, Chi-squared Distribution, and F Distribution <br>

- **Prime Factorization using Sieve O(log n) for multiple queries.py** <br>
An O(log n) alogarithm for factorizing primes. This code is contributed by Mohit Kumar <br> 

- **Common Commands in R for Data Manipulation.R** <br>
Some common read and write commands for your Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V without reading the documentation <br>

- **Common Commands in pandas for Data Manipulation.py** <br>
Some common read and write commands for your Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V without reading the documentation <br>

- **Clicker.py** <br>
